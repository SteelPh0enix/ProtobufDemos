# Python Protobuf examples

## Requirements

To run these examples, you have to install [`protobuf`](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/) package via `pip` or your OS package manager.

To modify the `proto` files, and re-generate them, you need `protoc` installed. You can get it either from your favourite package manager, or directly from Google repository, [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads). You need **only** `protoc` executable for that, ignore other files.

For detailed description, see the [official Google guide on Protobuf with Python](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial)
